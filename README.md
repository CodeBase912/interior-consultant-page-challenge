## Overview

### Challenge

Create a homepage following the design. The page should be responsive. Fulfill user stories below

#### User stories

- User can see a page following the given design
- On mobile, user can see a collapsed navigation
- On mobile, when the user selects the hamburger menu, user can see the navigation

### My Solution

#### Built With

<!-- This section should list any major frameworks that you built your project using. Here are a few examples.-->

- Semantic HTML markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Flexbox
- <a href="https://en.bem.info/methodology/" target="_blank">BEM</a> naming convention - useful for avoiding conflicting class names

#### Experience

This project was pretty fun to build. I decided to also work on implementing a continuous build/deployment workflow using netlify which was pretty cool. Another feature I also decided to add was an asset bundler for bundling all static assets (like images and css files) as well as minifying js files into one file. I decided to use <a href="https://rollupjs.org" target="_blank">Rollup.js</a> for this with a <a href="https://github.com/rollup/plugins/tree/master/packages/babel" target="_blank">babel plugin for Rollup</a> to transpile ES6+ js to older versions of js to suport older browsers. Really liked working with this setup so I'm probably gonna use it for future javascript projects.
